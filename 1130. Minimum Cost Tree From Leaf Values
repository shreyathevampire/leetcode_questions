''' we first considered the non -leaf nodes by taking the product of the local smallest value and taking the product
of the value with the minimum value neighbour.
the rest over values in vector indicate the leaf nodes as as the question specifies we pick up the maximum leaf node values from left
right subtree and take the product of it.
